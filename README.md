# Python Micro-Bite Projects

Welcome to the Python Micro-Bite Projects repository! This collection contains various small projects implemented in Python for micro-controller boards. To execute the code in this repository, you will need two micro:bit boards. Follow the instructions below to set up the gamepad and console code on each board.

## Requirements
- Two micro:bit boards

## Setting Up the Gamepad
1. Open the `gamepad_code.py` file.
2. Copy the code and paste it into the MicroPython editor for the micro:bit connected to the gamepad.

## Setting Up the Console
1. Open the `console_code.py` file.
2. Copy the code and paste it into the MicroPython editor for the other micro:bit connected to the console.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure that both micro:bit boards are properly connected and powered.
2. Flash the code to each micro:bit.
3. Once the code is uploaded, the gamepad and console are ready to communicate.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code in this repository. If you have any questions or improvements, don't hesitate to contribute or reach out to the community.

Happy coding!
